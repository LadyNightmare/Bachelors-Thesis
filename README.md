Alcohol is a legal drug that is sometimes overused and/or misused. This can affect not
only who uses it, but who surrounds them, since the behavior of the subject can lead to
situations such as a fight or a traffic accident. The objective of this project is the detection
of possible alcohol abuse in order to inform the user and facilitate better decision-making.
For this purpose a digital eye movement detection system has been designed with which
to detect involuntary movements caused by the effect of alcohol on the nervous system.
The usability and performance of the developed application have been evaluated using a
System Usability Scale, in which different aspects of the system are scored. After this
evaluation, the application has proven to be useful, usable and practical.
